	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>RECON is a web series dramedy about a group of queer college freshmen and their attempts to balance their personal lives and relationships-- while training to be spies. Set entirely at a secret, unnamed school for spies, the show follows newly-out, midwestern Jodie, a skilled hacker who’s finally able to come out and make friends at her new school. While she’s able to make friends quickly), everything falls apart when she finds out that her entire life is being recorded and posted online in neatly edited, five to ten minute episodes. Created by Emma Drewry, RECON is written and produced by a team of diverse queer students and professionals in Los Angeles, CA. </p>
